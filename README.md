# LED Board Fault Tester using Arduino Mega

## üßæ Description

This project presents a fault detection device for LED circuit boards, developed using the **Arduino Mega 2560** microcontroller. The system supports testing three different types of LED boards (1 LED, 2 LEDs, and 3 LEDs), with selectable modes via a 5-pin joystick.

Test results are displayed on a 2004 LCD screen with I2C communication. Fault data is stored in `.csv` format on an SD card, and the timestamp of each test is accurately recorded using the DS3231 real-time clock (RTC) module.
